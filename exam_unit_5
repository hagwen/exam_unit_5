(Verse 1: Understanding) 
Yo, programming's like a maze, hard to comprehend,  

If you ain't versed in the code, it's hard to transcend.  

Had to switch up my mindset, new way to think,  

Solving problems with code, my brain had to synchronize. 

Needed explanations, to break through the wall,  

Now I'm crafting solutions, standing tall. 

(Verse 2: Knowledge) 
From loops to Booleans, I've delved into the deep,  

Basic conditionals, if and else, take a leap.  

True and false, like a dance, in binary trance,  

Variables hold the key, in this digital romance.  

Naming's crucial, GitHub's my stage,  

Int, string, double, turn the page.  

With dictionaries in hand, and screens to start,  

I'm painting with code, crafting my art. 

(Verse 3: Extended Concepts) 
Extensions bring flair, like a rapper's twist,  

Methods stretching boundaries, can't resist.  

Interfaces link the chain, code's harmony,  

Inheritance, passing down, legacy.  

From the base to the derived, we rise,  

Code's evolution, no surprise.  

So here's to coding, a rap of the trade,  

Where understanding meets knowledge, in the code cascade. 

(Bridge) 
So as I wrap this verse, let's recap the year,  

With Tony, my trusted helper, ever sincere,  

And Simonsen, the beacon of knowledge, ever near.  

From confusion to clarity, shedding every tear, 

With knowledge as my guide, and concepts in my hand,  

I've journeyed through the code, like grains of sand. 

(Ending) 
That's what I've learned, this past year's ride,  

From understanding to mastery, with Tony by my side.  

Guided by Simonsen's wisdom, in every stride,  

His lessons echo in my mind, a steady tide.  

With patience and passion, he illuminated the way,  

Through the maze of algorithms, day by day.  

And Tony with boundless grace,  

You lend a helping hand, in every case.  

So here's to the future, with challenges to face,  

In this coding journey, I've found my place.
